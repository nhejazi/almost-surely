**<u>Disclaimer</u>:** _At no time and under no circumstances are the ideas

This blog is dedicated to exploring statistics, science, software, and their
myriad interactions in our modern world, as construed loosely by me, [Nima
Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org). The scope is necessarily broad -- hopefully,
ideas from statistical causal inference, nonparametric statistics,
semiparametric theory, high-dimensional probability, machine learning,
optimization, information theory, statistical computing, data science, applied
statistics, and computational biology will all be explored -- with the variety
of topics necessarily explored to varying degrees of depth. The central goal of
each post will be to explore the relationship between a statistical issue and
how that issue may impact science and policy. On occasion, posts that diverge
from the topics above may appear.

_Trivialities:_ Though it emerged rather whimsically, the name of this blog
merits some explanation -- specifically, the term "almost surely," from the
notion of [_almost sure
convergence_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables#Almost_sure_convergence),
first captured my attention when I was studying the theory of stochastic
convergence (of random variables). The choice of title now seems rather fitting
given the topics to which this blog is dedicated.
