title = "Almost Surely: musings on statistics and science"
+++

This is a blog dedicated to exploring statistics, science, and their myriad
interactions in our modern world, as construed by [Nima
Hejazi](http://nimahejazi.org). The scope is necessarily broad -- hopefully,
ideas from nonparametric statistics, semiparametric theory, high-dimensional
probability, machine learning, causal inference, information theory, modern
optimization, statistical computing, data science, and applied statistics will
all be explored in depth. The goal, nearly always, will be to explore the topic
at hand with an eye towards the role that statistics ought to play in shaping
science and policy in our modern world.

_At no time and under no circumstances are the ideas expressed here endorsed by
my employer or any organization with which I may be affiliated._

_Trivialities_: Though it emerged rather whimsically, the name of this blog
merits some explanation -- specifically, the term "almost surely", from the
notion of [almost sure
convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables#Almost_sure_convergence),
first captured my attention when I was studying stochastic convergence theory.
In particular, this choice of title seems rather fitting given the nature of the
topics to which this blog is dedicated.
