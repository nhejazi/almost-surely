      <title>renjin: put some Java in your R</title>

      <description>R is a great, highly flexible language for statistical computing, but it does suffer greatly from performance issues. As I’ve steadily increase my use of R, I quickly became aware that I would have to one day learn to integrate R with a programming language with better performance, the main choice here being C++. To integrate R with C++, the Rcpp framework (and R package) was created, allowing for parts of the R code of a given package or project to be re-written in C++ and easily integrated with R.</description>

      <title>taking blogdown for a test drive</title>

      <description>Recently, I came across the blogdown R package, a variant of RStudio’s popular bookdown R package, made by Yihui Xie and Amber Thomas. Blogdown allows the user to write blog posts with code chunks, in any of the large variety of languages supported by RMarkdown, allowing for computationally reproducible writing and programming. It also plays well with the new static site engine Hugo. Here, I’m mostly just going to take blogdown for a spin.</description>

      <title>a shell called xonsh</title>

      <description>Any computational scientist who spends their time writing and using tools or analyzing data has certainly had to spend a great deal of his/her time interacting with a command line interface (as an aside, I at one point spent so much time staring at the command line that I wrote a set of scripts to provide me with comical quotes to break up the monotony of my work &amp;ndash; it can be found here).</description>

      <title>how to love a tool - atom</title>

      <description>As part of the series of posts on computational tools that I have grown to love (&amp;ldquo;How to Love a Tool&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;), here, I am going to talk about the Atom text editor, developed rather recently by GitHub. Unlike the other text editor I discussed in this series of blog posts - the awesome and minimal Neovim - Atom is designed to be &amp;ldquo;a hackable text editor for the 21st Century,&amp;rdquo; built mostly on web-based technologies (e.</description>

      <title>how to love a tool - gitsome</title>

      <description>After adopting the minimalistic yet awesome Neovim as my new all-purpose text editor, I happened upon a new (and truly awesome!) shell, designed for heavy interaction with GitHub. After a few hours of playing around with this new tool, I am confident that using this new shell, playfully titled gitsome (think, &amp;ldquo;get some,&amp;rdquo; or maybe that&amp;rsquo;s just me reading in between the lines too much?), really does improve productivity tremendously. Of course nothing can take the place of Bash for general use (principally due to how ubiquitous Bash appears to be), but gitsome, and the underlying shell on which it is based (Xonsh), provides a look at what a modern shell environment ought to look like&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Recently, I decided to look for new tools to improve my work efficiency, and very early in the endeavor to find new and better tools, I came across the fairly recent Neovim project. The aim of Neovim is to accomplish a full re-factoring of the source code of Vim, one of the oldest and most popular extensible text editors; this is sort of a big deal because Vim has historically been maintained only by its creator Bram Moolenaar, and not every change made to Vim has been done in a forward-thinking manner.</description>

      <title>R graphics - ggplot versus base</title>
      <link>http://nimahejazi.org/blog/post/r-graphics-ggplot-v-base/</link>

      <description>In the past several weeks, something of a debate has emerged regarding whether, in fact, there is a superior plotting system in R. First, a bit of history. The arguments on plotting all began with an off-hand comment about the plotting preferences of statistician and JHU Professor Jeff Leek, on the &amp;ldquo;Not So Standard Deviations&amp;rdquo; podcast of Hilary Parker and Roger Peng. The comment, as I remember it, had to do with why anyone would ever bother to use base graphics in R when a tool like ggplot2 exists.</description>

      <title>quantified self with Fitbit, part 1</title>

      <description>An interesting phenomenon that has appeared in recent years is the notion of &amp;ldquo;Quantified Self&amp;rdquo; - simply the idea that quantifying much of our daily activity can lead to insights about our behaviors, and that a more thorough knowledge of our own behavior can help us to be more mindful of our health and lifestyle choices. In a previous post, I explored (in a very rudimentary fashion) information about my genome, in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms sequenced by 23andMe™.</description>

      <description>In recent years, the growing trend of personal genomics has spawned its own industry, with several companies now offering to sequence the genomes of individuals, with some even providing health analytics and ancestry information. A couple years ago, I sent a sample of my own DNA (via saliva) to 23andMe, Inc.; this sample was then used to perform sequencing on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in my genome &amp;ndash; and to provide me with a wealth of information about potential disease risks and ancestry.</description>

      <title>drunk driving with spreadsheets</title>
      <link>http://nimahejazi.org/blog/post/drunk-driving-with-spreadsheets/</link>

      <description>Recently, while listening to an episode of the podcast &amp;ldquo;Not So Standard Deviations&amp;rdquo;, by Roger Peng and Hilary Parker, the line &amp;ldquo;Doing data analysis with spreadsheets is like driving drunk&amp;rdquo; (attributed to statistician Philip Stark) stood out to me. This short phrase gets at the very notion of how very irresponsible the use of spreadsheets is for many of the routine tasks of data science. That is, spreadsheets provide a high level of accessibility to the data that is so central to the insights extracted by data scientists &amp;ndash; and, it is this high level of control over the data itself that makes their use so very dangerous.</description>

      <title>Almost Surely: musings on statistics and science</title>

      <description>This is a blog dedicated to exploring statistics, science, and their myriad interactions in our modern world, as construed by Nima Hejazi. The scope is necessarily broad &amp;ndash; hopefully, ideas from nonparametric statistics, semiparametric theory, high-dimensional probability, machine learning, causal inference, information theory, modern optimization, statistical computing, data science, and applied statistics will all be explored in depth. The goal, nearly always, will be to explore the topic at hand with an eye towards the role that statistics ought to play in shaping science and policy in our modern world.</description>
