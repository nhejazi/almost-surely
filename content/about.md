This blog is dedicated to exploring statistics, science, and their myriad
interactions in our modern world, as construed loosely by [Nima
Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org). The scope is necessarily broad -- hopefully,
ideas from causal inference, nonparametric statistics, semiparametric theory,
high-dimensional probability, machine learning, optimization, information
theory, statistical computing, data science, applied statistics, and
computational biology will all be explored, though to varying degrees of depth.
In nearly all cases, the goal of a given post will be to explore the particular
topic at hand with an eye towards examining the manner in which the statistical
issue at hand impacts science and policy.

_Trivialities:_ Though it emerged rather whimsically, the name of this blog
merits some explanation -- specifically, the term "almost surely," from the
notion of [_almost sure
convergence_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables#Almost_sure_convergence),
first captured my attention when I was studying the theory of stochastic
convergence (of random variables). The choice of title now seems rather fitting
given the topics to which this blog is dedicated.
