"Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man."
In these few words, Francis Bacon captured the notion that writing is requisite 
for the formulation of consistent and ordered thoughts.

In applying this principle here, I aim to pen my thoughts with careful attention
paid to the maximization of their clarity and consistency -- that is, here, I
mean to slow down, organize, and explore my thinking on those topics that most
readily capture my attention. The goal ultimately is to combat -- or, failing
that, at least escape -- the fast-paced and unstructured style of thinking
unfortunately encouraged by our modern ease of access to both information and
opinions. In escaping this deluge of external opinions, it is my hope that the
thoughts produced here will be informed singularly by those experiences and
schools of thought that have shaped my way of thinking. Here, I plan to discuss
exciting ideas and breakthroughs in applied statistics, data science, scientific
computing, and the biomedical sciences.
