<p>R is a great, highly flexible language for statistical computing, but it does suffer greatly from performance issues. As Iâ€™ve steadily increase my use of R, I quickly became aware that I would have to one day learn to integrate R with a programming language with better performance, the main choice here being C++. To integrate R with C++, the <code>Rcpp</code> framework (and R package) was created, allowing for parts of the R code of a given package or project to be re-written in C++ and easily integrated with R. Using <code>Rcpp</code> comes with great advantages in terms of R code performance; however, it obviously requires that one learn C++. I was about to devote a great deal of time to doing so, when â€“ fortuitously â€“ I came across the rather new <a href="http://www.renjin.org/"><code>renjin</code> project</a>. Renjin is a new (in-development) interpreter for GNU R that relies on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to enhance Râ€™s performance. The idea seems to be that it can eventually serve as a drop-in replacement for GNU R. It seems that the <code>renjin</code> R package can be used to provide performance gains via interfacing with the JVM, just by wrapping standard R code.</p>
<section id="minimal-example" class="level2">
<h2>Minimal example</h2>
<p>For now, I just thought I would try the example from the <code>renjin</code> R package documentation, more involved examples might be added to this post later or come in separate blog posts of their own. Here we go:</p>
<p>Letâ€™s make sure we have the newest version of Renjin:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if (!require(renjin)) {
install.packages(&quot;https://nexus.bedatadriven.com/content/groups/public/org/renjin/renjin-gnur-package/0.8.2404/renjin-gnur-package-0.8.2404.tar.gz&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: renjin</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(renjin)</code></pre>
<p>Letâ€™s define a function to simply add by iteration:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bigsum &lt;- function(n) {
  sum &lt;- 0
  for(i in seq(from = 1, to = n)) {
    sum &lt;- sum + i
  }
  sum
}</code></pre>
<p>We can improve the speed of this function by pre-compiling it to bytecode using Râ€™s native bytecode compiler. Weâ€™d expect this to save us some time relative to the naive implementation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bigsumc &lt;- compiler::cmpfun(bigsum) # GNU R&#39;s byte code compiler</code></pre>
<p>Alright, now weâ€™re ready to compare the performances of the naive and bytecode-compiled implementations:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>time_norm &lt;- system.time(bigsum(1e7))
time_comp &lt;- system.time(bigsumc(1e7))</code></pre>
<p>Notice that directly using Râ€™s native bytecode compiler improves the performance of our <code>bigsum</code> function quite a bit â€“ that is, considering the time the system spends on the computation, we save about 0.01 seconds, (roughly) a factor of 3. Maybe <code>renjin</code> can help us out even more?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>time_renjin &lt;- system.time(renjin(bigsum(1e7)))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>table &lt;- as.data.frame(rbind(as.numeric(time_norm), as.numeric(time_comp),
                             as.numeric(time_renjin)))[, c(1, 2, 3)]
colnames(table) &lt;- c(&quot;user&quot;, &quot;system&quot;, &quot;total&quot;)
rownames(table) &lt;- c(&quot;naive&quot;, &quot;cmpfun&quot;, &quot;renjin&quot;)
print(table)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##         user system total
## naive  0.427  0.020 0.452
## cmpfun 0.440  0.007 0.449
## renjin 0.523  0.028 0.282</code></pre>
<p>Wow â€“ just, wow. The gain in computational efficiency here is incredible! Using <code>renjin</code> â€“ even just as a wrapper â€“ improves the time cost (on the system side) by a factor of 1 relative to the naive implementation and by quite a bit still (<strong>a factor of 0</strong>) when compared to the bytecode-compiled version of our function. Damn â€“ Iâ€™m at a loss for words. This was just a simple example, but we were able to save so much computational time just by naively calling <code>renjin</code>â€¦and it took just a few extra characters to call it as a wrapperâ€¦</p>
<p>Although Renjin is still in its infancy, I canâ€™t help but be excited for the future of R â€“ and statistical computing in general â€“ with how well its already performing. Weâ€™re going to be able to (try to) do great things with these new tools ðŸŒŸ</p>
