Hey, [I'm Nima](https://nimahejazi.org), and this is an attempt at a blog...a
collection of thoughts (loosely) on exploring statistics and software, and the
myriad ways that their interactions shape modern science. I hope that, at times,
posts will touch on ideas from causal inference, nonparametric statistics,
machine learning, statistical computing, and "data science" (whatever that last
one means).
