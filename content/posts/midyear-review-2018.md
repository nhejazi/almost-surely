"Hindsight is 20-20," at least that's how the saying goes...

As of a few weeks ago (Friday, 11 May 2018), I find myself with yet another year
of graduate school behind me --- and perhaps now is a good time to ponder how
the last year has changed me. Surely, I've gained in my statistics education
(maybe?) but what of my goals? Do I still want the same things as I did just
last year? For now, it seems that things have changed considerably.

At the beginning of this past academic year, which marked my first in the PhD
program in Biostatistics (and my second year of graduate school), I wanted ---
badly wanted --- a future career in the academy, alongside expertise in methods
at the cutting-edge of computational statistics. Now, I find myself dissatisfied
with academia --- in large part due to the sort of individual conduct that is
actively tolerated and the personality politics that seem to dominate the
landscape --- and find my interests and goals better aligned with what seems to
be more highly valued in industry research settings. Really, what's the point of
new and exciting theory if it never sees a chance to shape the world? For this,
we need to actively encourage and reward the development of robust software
tools (at least in Statistics). Unfortunately, such an attitude has not yet been
realized, though the data science push has moved us closer. Where before I found
myself extremely interested in computational methods, I now find myself drawn
once again to the applications of statistics in science (having decided to
pursue a graduate minor in "computational and genomic biology" in place of one
more focused on "data science"). Though I've yet to give it another try, it may
well be that the same issues of personality politics exist in industry settings
as well --- who knows?

For all these apparent changes in attitude and goals, much has remained the
same --- I still find myself interested in issues at the intersection of causal
inference and machine learning, nonparametric statistics, and the myriad
applications of these tools in the sciences (with a rekindled interest in
computational biology due to a seminar with Nir Yosef) and policy (due to a
chance to discover issues in algorithmic fairness through a seminar with Moritz
Hardt). Over the last year, I've started working much more closely with David
Benkeser (now at Emory) on a project broadly concerned with causal inference
using stochastic interventions and Mark van der Laan (now my primary advisor) on
topics ranging from the highly adaptive lasso to differential methylation
analysis; moreover, I've also continued working with Nick Jewell (soon to move
to the London School of Hygiene) on a project concerning survival analysis in
settings in which careless analyses may be plagued by immortal time bias while
a methods project (on applying Bayes shrinkage to Targeted Learning) and applied
work with Alan Hubbard has largely been left to stagnate. A current hope is that
several of these methods projects will be ready for publication by the end of
the present summer.

These ramblings seem to be getting a bit too long-winded, so now seems a good
place to stop. I'm hoping to follow up with a post to set goals for my next year
in graduate school soon, before the summer's end. In the mean time, I plan to
dedicate time to posting reading notes on causal inference and topics related to
stochastic interventions on [my statistics blog](https://blog.nimahejazi.org) as
preparation for my qualifying exam, to take place on Friday, 14 September 2018.
