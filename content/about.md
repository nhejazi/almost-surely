This blog is dedicated to exploring statistics, science, software, and their
myriad interactions in our modern world, as construed loosely by me, [Nima
Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org). The scope is necessarily broad -- hopefully,
ideas from causal inference, nonparametrics, semiparametric theory,
high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, statistical information theory,
statistical computing and data science, and computational biology will all be
explored -- with the variety of topics necessarily explored to varying degrees
of depth. The central goal of each post will be to explore the relationship
between a statistical issue and how that issue may impact science and policy. On
occasion, posts that diverge from the topics above appear.

_Trivialities:_ Though it emerged rather whimsically, the name of this blog
merits some explanation -- that is, the term "almost surely" recalls [_almost
sure convergence_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables#Almost_sure_convergence),
which first captured my attention when I was introduced to theoretical
statistics. The choice of title now seems rather fitting.
