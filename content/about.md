This blog is dedicated to exploring statistics, science, and their myriad
interactions in our modern world, as construed by [Nima
Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org). The scope is necessarily broad -- hopefully,
ideas from nonparametric statistics, semiparametric theory, high-dimensional
probability, machine learning, causal inference, information theory,
optimization, statistical computing, data science, applied statistics, and
computational biology will be explored, to varying degrees of depth. In nearly
all cases, the goal of a post will be to explore the topic at hand with an eye
towards examining its relationship with statistics, science and policy.

_At no time and under no circumstances are the ideas expressed here necessarily
endorsed by any organization with which I may be affiliated._

_Trivialities_: Though it emerged rather whimsically, the name of this blog
merits some explanation -- specifically, the term "almost surely", from the
notion of [almost sure
convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables#Almost_sure_convergence),
first captured my attention when I was studying stochastic convergence theory.
In particular, this choice of title seems rather fitting given the nature of the
topics to which this blog is dedicated.
