The name of this blog is taken from various ideas in stochastic convergence
theory -- in particular, "almost surely" is intended as a reference to the
notion of [almost sure
convergence.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables#Almost_sure_convergence)

Though this choice of title emerged rather whimsically, it now seems quite
fitting given the nature of the topics to which I have chosen to dedicate this
blog -- what will hopefully be a mixture of interesting, modern ideas from
theoretical statistics, applied statistics (in particular, biostatistics), data
science, causal inference, information theory, scientific computing, and, to a
more limited extent, the biomedical sciences.
