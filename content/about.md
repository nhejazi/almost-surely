Hey, [I am Nima](https://nimahejazi.org), and this is my attempt at a blog. Most
likely, it will turn out to be a collection of thoughts (loosely) on exploring
statistics and software, and the myriad ways that their interactions shape
modern science. I hope that, at times, posts will touch on ideas from causal
inference, nonparametric statistics, machine learning, statistical computing,
and "data science" (whatever that last one means).
